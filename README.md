# undergraduate CS repository

This is a compilation of the source code for to coursework assignments taken at Colorado State University - Global for my Undergraduate Degree in Computer Science, from November 2021 to July 2023.

I used Visual Studio Code unless required to use another editor, such as Android Studio or Eclipse IDE.
